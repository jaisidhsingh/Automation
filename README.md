# Automation-Bots
This is a repository containing some basic automation projects using some popular python libraries like selenium and tweepy. Through these projects I have developed a working (if not, basic) knowlwedge of automation and believe I have learnt the most important skill in this field, effeciently googling documentation for whatever API I decide to torture myself with (lol). As a first year student, I'm still learning and I look forward to working with people.
